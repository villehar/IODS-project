# Week 5: Clustering and classification

## Excercise 4: Analysis exercises

I starter the week's exercise by downloading the Boston data set included in the MASS package. The Boston data frame has 506 rows (observations) and 14 columns (variables). The data contains variables such as per capita crime rate (crim), proportion of non-retail business acres per town (indus), full-value property-tax rate per \$10,000 (tax), and proportion of blacks by town (black). All the variables are continuous.

```{r}
library(MASS)
data("Boston")
str(Boston)

```

```{r}
library(GGally)
library(ggplot2)
explot <- ggpairs(Boston, mapping = aes(), lower = list(combo = wrap("facethist", bins = 20)))
explot

```
