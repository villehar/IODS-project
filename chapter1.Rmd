The introduction to data science course takes us to a tour that introduces us to the core themes of open data science. Along the course we will learn the principles and advantages of using open research tools and open data to do reproducible research. To achieve this goal, We wil learn how to use some of the most common open rresearch tools, such R, Rstudio, Rmarkdown and GitHub. In addtition, we well learn to apply these tools for running a set of statistical methods, including linear models and data clustering.
